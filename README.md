### *Let the Goodtimes roll!*

## Summary:

Goodtimes is designed to help friends select the time and place to hang out that works best for the group. By simply casting votes, everyone can avoid those never-ending group texts that decide nothing. Get ready to organize a get-together faster than ever before!

## Features:

Users can create an account where all their events are stored...

After selecting the options for the event, Goodtimes auto-generates a form users can send to friends.
