## Summary:

Goodtimes is designed to help friends select the time and place to hang out that works best for the group. By simply casting votes, everyone can avoid those never-ending group texts that decide nothing. Get ready to organize a get-together faster than ever before!

## Features:

Users can create an account where all their events are stored...

After selecting the options for the event, Goodtimes auto-generates a form that can be publically accessed.
You can email your friends directly from the Goodtimes website and send them a bitly link that will take them to the voting form.

//Users' friends can vote on the times and places that work best for them...


...and users can check the results of the votes on their dashboard.
